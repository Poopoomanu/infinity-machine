## Core Result: Shared Law Wins Compression

| Metric | Shared 𝓣 (Machine) | Local Models | Winner |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| **BIC (MDL)** | **1466.42** | 1817.34 | **Machine** |
| **NLL** | 2.241 | 1.850 | Local |
| **KS-sum** | 4.175 | 4.053 | Local |

> **ΔBIC ≈ 350** → **One law compresses reality better than five separate ones**
